# About

JavaStatAnalyzer is a Java program that performs statistical analyses on user-provided data. It includes functions like finding the smallest element in an array, calculating the mean, and computing the standard deviation. The program also allows users to dynamically input student names and scores, prompting them until they enter a blank name. Overall, JavaStatAnalyzer is a useful tool for basic statistical computations and data collection tasks.

# Features

JavaStatAnalyzer is a powerful tool that offers several impressive features. It includes a Smallest Element Finder function, which helps users find the smallest element in an array. It also provides a means calculation function, which is fundamental in statistics. The program allows users to input data like exam scores or temperature readings, and the average is calculated. The standard deviation computation measures the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean, providing insights into how closely values cluster around the average. The program also allows dynamic student data input, ensuring a seamless data collection process. JavaStatAnalyzer is useful for basic statistical tasks, such as student analysis, teacher tracking, and researcher collection. It is a valuable tool for anyone working with data in Java and bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful insights.

# Rating

The code contains numerous syntax and logic errors that prevent it from compiling or running. These include incorrect capitalization, missing semicolons at the end of statements, misspelled methods, incorrect method signatures in the main method, and missing type declarations in variable declarations. Despite these issues, there are significant logic errors, such as the idexOfSmallestElement method declaring the smallest element in an array of integers instead of an array of doubles, the loop condition resulting in an infinite loop, and confusion between arrays and ArrayLists, causing compilation errors.
The project aims to find the mean and deviation of numbers and input student names and scores, but due to these errors, the functionality is not realized. The code lacks proper indentation and consistent formatting, making it difficult to read and understand. Variable names are sometimes inconsistent, and there are misspellings, such as "idexOfSmallestElement."
In conclusion, the project demonstrates an attempt to implement various functionalities but falls short due to numerous syntax and logic errors. Significant revisions are needed to improve the code's compileability, runability, and overall quality.
