# About

JavaStatAnalyzer is a Java program that performs statistical analyses on user-provided data. It includes functions like finding the smallest element in an array, calculating the mean, and computing the standard deviation. The program also allows users to dynamically input student names and scores, prompting them until they enter a blank name. Overall, JavaStatAnalyzer is a useful tool for basic statistical computations and data collection tasks.

# Features

JavaStatAnalyzer is a powerful tool that offers several impressive features. It includes a Smallest Element Finder function, which helps users find the smallest element in an array. It also provides a means calculation function, which is fundamental in statistics. The program allows users to input data like exam scores or temperature readings, and the average is calculated. The standard deviation computation measures the spread or dispersion of data points around the mean, providing insights into how closely values cluster around the average. The program also allows dynamic student data input, ensuring a seamless data collection process. JavaStatAnalyzer is useful for basic statistical tasks, such as student analysis, teacher tracking, and researcher collection. It is a valuable tool for anyone working with data in Java and bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful insights.
